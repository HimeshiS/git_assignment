# Git Assignment - HimeshiS

a. What is an issue?
It is a feature on GitHub that allows us to track requested changes and features in a software project. When creating an issue, a task list can be added that can be checked off by team members as the tasks are completed. Issues are a helpful tool for project management and collaboration among teams working together on software development.

b. What is a pull request?
It is a feature in GitHub that allows developers to request changes from one branch of a repository to be merged into another branch, typically the main branch. In software development, different branches are created to enable team members to work on separate features at the same time. Pull requests are a collaborative feature that allows the team to review the new code, test it and discuss any issues before merging the changes onto the main branch. 

c. Describe the steps to open a pull request?
Navigate to the repository on GitHub where you want to create the pull request and click on the 'Pull requests' tab (third from left). Click on the green 'New' button in the top right of the Pull requests page which opens up a page titled Compare changes. Use the drop-down menus to select the main branch of the repository on the left hand side of the arrow and the branch being merged on the right hand side of the arrow. This ensures that the pull request is being created to merge the branch in question into the main branch of the same repository. Once the branches are selected, GitHub will show a comparison of the changes between the two branches that you can review to ensure accuracy. You can add a description and any other information to the description box. Click on the 'Create pull request' button to submit the pull request. 

d. Describe the steps to add a collaborator to a repository (share write permissions)
